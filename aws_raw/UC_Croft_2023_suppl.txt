Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligible patients were 5-17 years of age, with body weight of 18-90 kg and a confirmed diagnosis of
mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), established by sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy with compatible histology.
Patients were excluded if they had severe UC, defined as Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 3 at
baseline, Crohn's disease, bleeding disorders, and/or active peptic ulcer disease. The common prior treatments
that are excluded medications for this study are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. During the study,
administration of the following medication was not permitted and would result in withdrawal of the subject:
Systemic or rectal corticosteroids
Other medications containing 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; e.g. sulfasalazine or
mesalamine/mesalazine), including topical administration
Immunomodulators (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and methotrexate)
Biologics (e.g. anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, such as infliximab)
Others: nicotine patches, any products containing fish oils (fish oils are prohibited unless on a stable
dose 4 weeks prior to the screening visit [Visit 1] and throughout study participation), or any
investigational or marketed drug that may interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-diarrhoeals, laxatives, antibiotics, and drugs that cause constipation
are permitted for up to 10 consecutive days if taken for a condition unrelated to UC. Prophylactic use of a stable
dose of aspirin up to 325 mg/day for cardiac disease was permitted. For mild/acute pain, acetaminophen was
recommended. Administration of seasonal vaccines was permitted during the study; however, routine
vaccinations should be deferred until after study completion where possible.

Study visits
Study visits occurred at the following time points after Visit 2, depending on the patient's partial Ulcerative
Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) score: Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 (double-blind acute [DBA] phase
withdrawal) in the DBA phase; Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 (open-label acute [OLA] phase withdrawal) in the
OLA phase; and Weeks 2-4, Week 13, and Week 26 (double-blind maintenance [DBM] phase withdrawal) in
the DBM phase.
Statistical analysis
This study was an estimation study with no formal hypothesis testing; therefore, the study was not powered to
detect differences between treatment groups. More than 100 patients were to be screened and up to 80 patients
were to be enrolled in the DBA phase of the study. After agreement with the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the sample size for the DBA phase was reduced to 53 patients owing to difficulties in
recruitment. P-values are presented as descriptive statistics only. The overall safety analysis set consisted of
3
randomised patients who had taken ≥1 doses of multimatrix mesalamine. An independent data monitoring
committee reviewed the safety data generated during the study.
In the DBA phase, the primary efficacy outcome was compared between treatment groups using an uncorrected
chi-square test on the DBA safety analysis set. The null hypothesis was that no difference was seen in the
proportion of patients with a clinical response at Week 8 when a high or low-dose multimatrix mesalamine was
administered. The numbers and proportions of patients with a clinical response at Week 8 and the difference
between treatment groups, together with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-values, were
calculated. The odds ratio (OR) comparing the two treatments and 95% CI were also calculated. In the DBM
phase, the primary efficacy outcome was compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
test stratified for three levels of Week 8 responder status (entered DBM phase directly, responder at Week 8 of
the DBA phase, or responder at Week 8 of the OLA phase) on the DBM phase safety analysis set. The null
hypothesis was that no difference was seen in the proportion of patients with a clinical response at Week 26
when a high or low dose of multimatrix mesalamine was administered. The numbers and proportions of patients
with a clinical response at Week 26 and the difference between treatment groups, together with the two-sided
95% CI and associated p-values were calculated. The OR comparing the two treatments, together with the 95%
CI and p-value, was also calculated.
In the DBA phase, clinical and endoscopic responses at Week 8 were compared between treatment groups using
a continuity-corrected chi-square test. The change in Daily Ulcerative Colitis Scale (DUCS) score from baseline
to Week 8 was compared between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance, including treatment group
as a factor and baseline DUCS score as a covariate. The percentage of patients with an improvement in Pediatric
Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score from baseline to Week 8 was compared between treatment
groups using a continuity-corrected chi-square test. In the DBM phase, clinical and endoscopic responses were
compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for prior response status
(entered the DBM phase directly, responder at Week 8 of the DBA phase, or responder at Week 8 of the OLA
phase). The change in DUCS score from DBM phase Week 0 to Week 26 was compared between treatment
groups using an analysis of covariance, including treatment group as a factor and DUCS score at DBM phase
Week 0 and prior response status as covariates. The percentage of patients in remission at DBM phase Week 26
was compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for prior response
status. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9·2 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

"Completed the study' includes subjects who entered the DBM phase from one of the acute phases, completed the Week 26 visit, and had follow-up assessment within 7 days of the last dose of the investigational
product, and subjects who entered directly into the DBM phase, completed the Week 26 visit, and had follow-up assessment within 7 days of the last dose of the investigational product.
Not continued in study' includes subjects who completed the DBA phase but did not continue into the OLA phase or the DBM phase. 'Not enrolled in double-blind maintenance phase' includes subjects who
completed the OLA phase who did not enrol in the DBM phase.
*Primary reason for discontinuation was the reason for discontinuation from the last phase that a subject was enrolled in, if the subject did not complete the phase. Subject 201-0017 withdrew from the DBM phase on
10 Oct 2018 but has missing reason for withdrawal. The subject had adverse events of diarrhoea and haematochezia on 23 Sep 2018.
Medication adherence was defined by use of 80%-120% of the study medication.
