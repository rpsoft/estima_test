eMethods 1. Methods and Statistical Analysis for Phase 2b Induction Substudy
Study Design and Patients:
The phase 2b substudy consisted of a dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 12-week induction substudy, an open-
label period, and an extension period for patients that failed to achieve clinical response per Adapted Mayo score at week 12 (eFigure 1). The
phase 2b induction substudy included a screening period of up to 35 days and an induction period of 12 weeks, with a 140-day follow-up period
from the last dose of the study drug. The phase 2b/3 induction studies were operationally seamless, where patients could continue to enroll into an
open-label risankizumab 1800 mg intravenous (IV) induction group during the analysis of the phase 2b dose-ranging study (eFigure 1).
Patients aged between 18 and 80 years of age, with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, defined by an Adapted Mayo score of
5 to 9 points, endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3 (confirmed by central review), and a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for at least 3 months prior
to baseline, were eligible for the study. For the phase 2b dose-ranging substudy, all patients were required to have previous intolerance or
inadequate response to 1 or more prior approved advanced therapies for ulcerative colitis (including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab,
vedolizumab). Patients with prior exposure to p40 inhibitors (eg, ustekinumab) or p19 inhibitors (eg, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab) were
excluded. Patients who achieved a clinical response to IV risankizumab (defined as a decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2
points and ≥ 30% from baseline, in addition to a decrease in rectal bleeding score [RBS] ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1) at week 12 or 24 of induction
were eligible for randomization into the risankizumab phase 3 maintenance study (Figure 1). A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is
included in eMethods 2.

Randomization and Masking:
In the dose-ranging, phase 2b induction substudy, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 via web-based Interactive Response Technologies
(IRT) to receive a single dose of IV risankizumab (600 mg [n = 61], 1200 mg [n = 61], 1800 mg [n = 58]) or placebo (n = 60) at weeks 0, 4, and 8.
Randomization was stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes, no) and baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7, > 7).
Additional patients were enrolled in the phase 2b study after enrollment completion of the dose-ranging substudy and received open-label
risankizumab 1800 mg IV (n = 340). The randomization at baseline was stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes, no) and baseline Adapted
Mayo score (≤ 7 VS. > 7). A ± 7-day window was permitted around all study visits. Nonresponding patients to risankizumab phase 2b induction
therapy entered an extended treatment period for an additional 12 weeks of treatment and were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either risankizumab
1800 mg IV (every 4 weeks), 180 mg subcutaneous (SC), or 360 mg SC ([every 8 weeks], not shown). Patients who achieved clinical response to
risankizumab IV or SC were enrolled in maintenance to risankizumab 180 mg, risankizumab 360 mg, or placebo SC (risankizumab withdrawal
group), every 8 weeks.
Endpoints:
The primary endpoint was clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at week 12. Secondary endpoints were assessed at week 12 unless
noted and included clinical response per Adapted Mayo score, clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo (week 4), histologic endoscopic
mucosal remission (HEMR), endoscopic improvement, and endoscopic remission.
Sample Size Calculation:
For the phase 2b substudy, assuming a clinical remission rate of 7% in the placebo group and a maximum of 25% in at least one of the
risankizumab treatment groups at week 12, a sample size of 60 patients per treatment group was sufficient to test for the presence of a dose-

response signal with an average power of approximately 87% at 5% level of significance (one-sided), via modeling using the multiple comparison
procedure - modeling (MCP-Mod) approach.
Statistical Analysis:
Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug during the induction
phase 2b substudy. For the primary endpoint, the dose-response relationships among the 3 risankizumab dose groups (600 mg, 1200 mg, and
1800 mg IV) and placebo group were characterized at week 12 using the MCP-Mod approach based on the intention to treat (ITT) population. 1,2
For categorical efficacy endpoints, pairwise comparisons between each risankizumab treatment group and placebo were performed using the 2-
sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes, no) and baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7, > 7).
Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used as the primary imputation method, which categorized any patient who did not have an evaluation during
a prespecified visit window (either due to missing assessment or due to early placebo (withdrawal) from the study) as a nonresponder for the visit.
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using a mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) model which includes the
categorical fixed effects of treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, stratification factors at randomization, and the continuous fixed
covariates of baseline measurement.

eMethods 3. Supplementary Methods for the Phase 3 Induction and Maintenance Studies
Concomitant Therapy
Patients taking conventional therapies, such as aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and/or ulcerative colitis-related antibiotics at
baseline continued their concomitant treatment for the duration of the phase 3 induction study.
Decreasing doses were prohibited during the study, except in the event of moderately to severely active treatment-related toxicities.
Patients taking corticosteroids at baseline were required to continue their concomitant treatment at the baseline dose for the duration of induction.
Patients who entered the 12-week blinded extended treatment period of induction were permitted to taper corticosteroids at the discretion of the
investigator. While stopping the taper was permitted, dose increases above the baseline dose was prohibited.
At week 0 of maintenance, patients on corticosteroid therapy were required to taper their dose to completion by maintenance week 8, with
the recommended tapering schedule provided on the next page. All efficacy measurements at or after initiating and/or increasing doses of any
corticosteroids were excluded. Starting at week 16, patients who demonstrated inadequate response (based upon increased symptom activity
and/or endoscopic confirmation of inflammation) could receive open-label risankizumab rescue therapy (ie, one single dose of risankizumab 1200
mg followed by 360 mg SC maintenance regimen, which was delivered as 4 injections [90 mg SC] every 8 weeks thereafter). Patients could
receive up to 2 rescue doses. Patients taking corticosteroids at week 0 who had a loss of satisfactory clinical response per the investigator's
judgment after the steroid taper had been initiated could have their corticosteroid dose increased up to the dose used at baseline of maintenance
per the investigator's discretion. Patients taking oral budesonide multi-matrix system formulation or oral beclomethasone were required to
discontinue medication without a taper.

Endpoint Definitions for Primary and Secondary Outcomes for Phase 3 Induction and Maintenance
Clinical Endpoints
Adapted Mayo score (score range 0-9): RBS, 0-3; stool frequency score (SFS, 0-3); endoscopy score (0-3). Higher scores indicate
more severe disease.
Partial Adapted Mayo score (score range 0-6): RBS (0-3); SFS (0-3). Higher scores indicate more severe disease.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Abdominal pain score: Abdominal pain was assessed using a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) to evaluate
symptom frequency and severity over time. The mean of the scores from the most recent 3 days, and up to 10 days, prior to each study
visit was calculated.
Bowel urgency, nocturnal bowel movements, or tenesmus: Each of these symptoms were scored independently as categorical
(dichotomous) variables with 2 response options, where the response option "Yes" meant the respondent did experience the symptom
within the past 24 hours and the response option "No" meant the respondent did not experience the symptom within the past 24 hours. For
computing affected days with symptom, daily responses of "No" were coded as 0 and "Yes" were coded as 1. Scores were determined by

calculating the sum of the numeric values over the 3 days, and up to 10 days, prior to each study visit. If scores for fewer than 3 days in
the 10 days prior to the study visit were available, then score was set to missing for that visit.
Sleep interruption: Sleep interruption scoring quantified the number of nights with sleep interruption due to ulcerative colitis symptoms in
the most recent week (i.e., 7 days) prior to each study visit. If patients answered "Yes" and "due to ulcerative colitis symptoms", they
received a score of 1 for that day; otherwise, patients received a score of 0. Scores were determined by calculating the mean of the
numeric values (0 for no sleep interruption due to ulcerative colitis symptoms, and 1 for sleep interruption due to ulcerative colitis
symptoms) over the most recent week (i.e., 7 days) and then multiplying the result by 7; therefore, scores ranged between 0 and 7 for
each study visit.
Fecal incontinence: Fecal incontinence scoring quantified the number of weekly episodes of accidental bowel leakage (e.g. accidental
soiling of underwear) prior to each study visit. Scores were determined by calculating the mean of the number of fecal incontinence
episodes over the most recent week (i.e., 7 days) prior to a study visit and then multiplying by 7.
Definitions for Study Endpoints in Both Induction and Maintenance
Clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score: SFS ≤ 1, and not greater than baseline, RBS of 0, and endoscopic subscore ≤ 1.
Clinical response per Adapted Mayo score: Decrease from baseline ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30%, in addition to a decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an
absolute RBS ≤ 1.
Clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo score: Decrease from baseline ≥ 1 point and ≥ 30%, in addition to a decrease in RBS ≥ 1
or an absolute RBS ≤ 1.
Endoscopic improvement: Endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 without the evidence of friability.
Endoscopic remission: Endoscopic subscore of 0.
© 2024 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.
Histological endoscopic mucosal improvement (HEMI): Endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 without evidence of friability and Geboes score
≤ 3.1.
HEMR: Endoscopic subscore of 0 and Geboes score < 2.0.
Histologic remission: Geboes score of < 2.0.
No bowel urgency: A mean score of 0 denoting the absence of symptoms for the 3 most recent days prior to each study visit.
No abdominal pain: A mean score of 0 denoting the absence of symptoms for the 3 most recent days prior to each study visit.
No nocturnal bowel movements: A mean score of 0 denoting the absence of symptoms for the 3 most recent days prior to each study
visit.
No tenesmus: A mean score of 0 denoting the absence of symptoms for the 3 most recent days prior to each study visit.
For all patient-reported outcomes (no bowel urgency, no abdominal pain, no nocturnal bowel movements, no tenesmus), the 3
most recent days should not include the day prior to endoscopy, the day the subject underwent endoscopy, and 2 days following
the endoscopy. Earlier diary entries will be used accordingly in order to provide the most recent data for 3 days prior to the
respective study visit.
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Endpoints
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F): A 13-item assessment of fatigue associated with disease and
how it impacts daily activities and function. Lower scores indicate greater fatigue.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ): This questionnaire consists of 32 questions divided into 4 dimensions: bowel
symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social function. The total score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores
representing better quality of life.
© 2024 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.
Definitions for Study Endpoints in Maintenance Only
Corticosteroid-free clinical remission: Clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at week 52 in patients who abstained from
corticosteroid use for 90 days.
Maintenance of clinical remission: Achievement of clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at week 52 in patients with clinical
remission at baseline of maintenance.
Maintenance of endoscopic improvement: Achievement of endoscopic improvement at week 52 in patients with endoscopic
improvement at baseline of maintenance.
Statistical Analysis for IL-22
An MMRM analysis was conducted on the log2 transformed biomarker values. In the mixed model, the outcome variable was the change
from baseline of the log2 transformed values. Baseline biomarker values were adjusted by including log2 (baseline) as a covariate. Treatment,
time, and treatment by time were fixed effects; and patient was a random effect. Least square mean estimates for treatment by time combinations
from the mixed model were used for reporting and comparisons. The least-square means of the change in the log scale were back-transformed to
the original scale, which gave a percent change from the baseline. Change from baseline comparisons within the treatment group were made at
weeks 4, 12, and 52, and Bonferroni adjusted P values were calculated.
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Assessments
Risankizumab serum levels were measured every 4 weeks, from week 4 through week 12 during induction, and for maintenance every 16
weeks through week 48, with a final measurement 4 weeks later at week 52; serum anti-drug antibodies including neutralizing antibodies were
measured according to the same schedule as risankizumab but also included induction baseline prior to risankizumab treatment. Assay methods
have been previously described.³

Safety Outcomes
Adverse events were coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 25.1. The severity of adverse events
and laboratory abnormalities was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE) and anaphylactic reactions were adjudicated by external independent adjudication committees. An external data monitoring

Additional Statistical Analysis For Induction and Maintenance
Overall Type I Error Control
The overall type I error rate for the primary and secondary endpoints for the double-blind, phase 3 induction period was controlled using a
graphical multiple-testing procedure (eFigure 4). The primary endpoint was tested at the prespecified significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). The
secondary efficacy endpoints were divided into 2 groups (eFigure 4). The first group included the first 10 secondary endpoints. The second group
included all the remaining 5 secondary endpoints which were tested using the Holm procedure. If the primary endpoint achieved statistical
significance, continued testing followed a prespecified weight of a allocation (eFigure 4). In the graph, the arrows specify the weight of a allocation
between nodes. Once a hypothesis was rejected (ie, deemed the endpoint is significant) at its assigned significance level, its significance level
was allocated to the subsequent node. If more than one arrow originates from a node, the significance level was split between multiple subsequent
nodes following the prespecified weight. The numbers on the arrows denote the weights. For example, weight 1 denotes 100% transfer of
significance level to the next node, and the weight ε denotes 0.02% of the overall significance level (corresponding to a of 0.02% X 0.05 =
0.00001) to be transferred.

For maintenance, the graphical testing procedure was similar to that performed for induction, with testing for the primary endpoint
beginning at the prespecified significance level of 0.025 (2-sided) for each risankizumab dose group compared with placebo. If the primary
endpoint achieved statistical significance, testing was continued following a prespecified weight of a allocation.
In eFigure 5, the arrows specify weight of a allocation between nodes. Once a hypothesis was rejected (ie, deemed the endpoint
significant) at its assigned significance level, the significance was allocated to the subsequent node. If more than one arrow originates from a
node, the significance level will be split between multiple subsequent nodes following the prespecified weight. The numbers on the arrows denote
the weights. For example, weight 1 denotes 100% transfer of significance level to the next node, and the weight ε denotes 0.04% of the overall
significance level each dose starts with (corresponding to a of 0.04% X 0.025=0.00001) to be transferred.
No type I error control was applied to the additional nonranked efficacy endpoints. The analysis for additional efficacy endpoints was
performed at the nominal a level of 0.05 (two-sided) for each dose.

The phase 3 induction and maintenance studies lasted up to 81 weeks and included a screening period that lasted up to 5 weeks, a 12-week
double-blind induction period (substudy 2), and a 52-week maintenance period.
ᵃRandomization for induction was stratified by the presence of baseline corticosteroid use (yes, no), baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤7, >7), and
number of prior failed advanced therapies (0, 1, > 1).
ᵇThe primary efficacy analysis population for phase 3 induction substudy 2 included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of
study drug during the first 12-week, double-blind induction period.

ᶜClinical responders after 12 weeks of risankizumab IV were randomized to the primary efficacy population of maintenance. Patients who did not
achieve a clinical response could receive an additional 12 weeks of risankizumab therapy during the induction extended treatment period (not
shown). Patients who were placebo nonresponders after 12 weeks who then received and responded to risankizumab 1200 mg or 1800 mg at 24
weeks were included in the rerandomization into maintenance (not shown).
Randomization was stratified by history of advanced therapy failure (yes, no), last risankizumab induction dose (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg), and
clinical remission status (per local evaluation) at the last visit of induction (yes, no).
eThe primary efficacy analysis population for maintenance included patients who achieved a clinical response per Adapted Mayo score after 12
weeks of risankizumab IV during the phase 2b dose-ranging substudy (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg), phase 2b open-label period (1800 mg), or
phase 3 induction (1200 mg).
Patients who experienced inadequate response were eligible for risankizumab rescue therapy starting at week 16 of maintenance (one dose of
1200 mg or 1800 mg followed by 360 mg every 8 weeks). Loss of response or inadequate response was based on clinical and endoscopic
symptoms (RBS at least 1 point greater than the week 0 value or endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3).

For each study, the subgroup analyses were conducted for prespecified subgroups for the primary efficacy endpoint.
No post hoc subgroups are shown. Point estimate and 95% CI for treatment difference between each risankizumab
group and placebo group were calculated using normal approximation to the binomial distribution. 95% CI for
difference were calculated using normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The calculations were based on
NRI incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to logistic restrictions (COVID-19 or the geopolitical
conflict in Ukraine and surrounding impacted regions) or NRI only if there were no missing data due to logistic
restrictions (COVID-19 or the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and surrounding impacted regions). If any of the resulting

The LS mean and 95% Cls for the synthetic results were based on MMRM, with week 0, treatment, visit,
treatment-by-visit interaction, and stratification factors. Median change from baseline and 95% CI were based
on nonparametric analysis. Nonparametric analysis was performed, with P values for the treatment comparisons
of each risankizumab dose versus placebo provided based on the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. C-reactive protein
and fecal calprotectin values were considered as observed before censoring. Week 0 was the last nonmissing
measurement before the first dose of study drug in maintenance. Patients with only nonmissing change from
week 0 values were included in this analysis. For eFigures 11A-D, *** P ≤ .001 RZB 1200 mg VS. PBO; eFigure

Data are presented are reported on nonmissing data and reported as n (%) unless stated otherwise. Reported here
are baseline demographics and disease characteristics at week 0 of induction and maintenance for the primary
efficacy populations of each study, which included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study
drug during the 12-week induction or 52-week maintenance studies after receiving risankizumab IV for one period
of 12 weeks in the induction study. Additional baseline demographics and disease characteristics are presented in
Table 1.
Also included are baseline characteristics and disease demographics for all patients who received risankizumab
1200 mg or placebo IV during induction and were randomized to maintenance. Treatment groups were named
according to treatments received during induction/maintenance.
For the patient-reported outcomes, the baseline disease characteristics were assessed in patients with disease
symptoms at baseline of induction.
ᵇThe body mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
°The multiple race category includes participants who responded to 2 or more categories. For reporting race,
patients were asked to respond to closed category questions, with the option of multiple selection.
ᵈAdapted Mayo score (score range 0-9): RBS, 0-3; SFS, 0-3; endoscopy score (0-3).
Endoscopy score was evaluated for each observed segment of the colon (rectum, sigmoid, descending colon,
transverse colon, ascending colon/cecum) using a 4-point scale, with a higher score indicating more severe
disease.
The reference range for C-reactive protein is 0 to 10 mg per liter.
⁹The reference value for fecal calprotectin is less than 50 µg per gram.
hAdvanced therapies included infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib,
and/or ozanimod. Inadequate response was defined as an inability to respond or unacceptable side effects to
therapy.

Reported here are maintenance efficacy outcomes at week 52 for all patients who received risankizumab 1200 mg or placebo during induction and
were randomized to maintenance. Treatment groups were named according to treatments received during induction/maintenance. Analyses for
placebo IV/placebo SC were not adjusted for multiplicity. Results for categorical endpoints (except occurrence of ulcerative colitis-related
hospitalization) were based on nonresponder imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to logistic restrictions (COVID-
19 or the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and surrounding impacted regions) (NRI-MI). Results for continuous endpoints were based on RTB-MI.
Between-group difference and 95% Cls were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel common rate difference with NRI-MI for categorical endpoints
(Normal approximation to binomial distribution for occurrence of hospitalization) and ANCOVA/MMRM with RTB-MI for continuous endpoints.* P≤
.05; ** P ≤ .01; *** P ≤ .001 versus risankizumab 1200 mg IV/placebo SC.

For induction, the patient population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug during the first 12-week study
period. For maintenance, the patient population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug after receiving IV
risankizumab (either 600 mg, 1200 mg, or 1800 mg) for 12 weeks in the phase 2b/3 induction studies, including those that went through the extended
treatment period. Results for categorical endpoints were based on NRI-MI to handle missing data due to logistic restrictions (COVID-19 or the
geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and surrounding impacted regions), apart from UC-related hospitalizations. Results for continuous endpoints were
based on RTB-MI. Point estimate and 95% CI for treatment differences were based on normal approximation to binomial distribution with NRI-MI for
categorical endpoints (normal approximation to Poisson distribution for UC-related hospitalization) and ANCOVA/MMRM with RTB-MI for continuous
endpoints. Type I error was not controlled for in this analysis.

eResults 1. Results for the Dose-Ranging Phase 2b Induction Substudy
Patient Characteristics
For the dose-ranging, placebo-controlled phase 2b induction substudy, 240 patients were enrolled
and randomized to receive risankizumab 600 mg (n = 61), 1200 mg (n = 61), 1800 mg (n = 58), or placebo (n
= 60) IV at weeks 0, 4, or 8. High completion rates across treatment groups (risankizumab 600 mg, 90.2%;
1200 mg, 95.1%; 1800 mg, 98.3%; placebo, 88.3%) were seen for the 12-week induction substudy (eFigure
2). A total of 17 patients discontinued (10 patients in the risankizumab treatment groups and 7 patients
treated with placebo) prior to week 12. Baseline characteristics and patient demographics were similar
across treatment groups (eTable 1). Mean duration of disease was 9.7 ± 6.9 years across all treatments,
with 100% of the patients being advanced therapy-inadequate response.
Efficacy Outcomes
Following the prespecified MCP-Mod analysis, no prespecified dose-response models were
statistically significant. However, in the pairwise comparisons, patients treated with risankizumab achieved
numerically higher rates of clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at week 12 compared with placebo,
with all risankizumab groups achieving nominal significance (pairwise P ≤ .1) (eFigure 3A). Clinical
remission was achieved by 7 patients (11.5%) treated with 600 mg; 6 patients (9.8%) treated with 1200 mg,
and 6 patients (10.3%) treated with 1800 mg, compared with 1 patient (1.7%) treated with placebo IV
(eFigure 3A).
Numerical improvements compared with placebo were observed for clinically relevant secondary
endpoints with nominal P≤.1 (eFigure 3B-F). Patients receiving any risankizumab dose had improved
clinical response (per Adapted Mayo score and Partial Adapted Mayo score) by week 4 compared to placebo
and maintained these improvements through week 12 (eFigure 3B-D).
Endoscopic improvement in patients treated with risankizumab 600 mg (24.6%), 1200 mg (13.1%),
and 1800 mg (15.5%) were numerically higher compared with placebo-treated patients
(5.0%, nominal P ≤ .1), (eFigure 3E). A numerically higher proportion of patients were observed in
endoscopic remission with risankizumab 600 mg (8.2%), 1200 mg (4.9%), and 1800 mg (8.6%) compared
with placebo (0%, P .1), (eFigure 3F).

Reductions in inflammatory biomarkers, hs-CRP and FCP, were observed by week 4 and maintained
to week 12, in patients treated with any risankizumab dose compared to placebo (eFigure 3G-H). Serum IL-
22 levels were significantly decreased from baseline in all dose groups compared with placebo at week 12 (P
≤ .001, all comparisons), (eFigure 31).
Patients enrolled in the open-label phase 2b period (n = 340) were treated with risankizumab 1800
mg, with 46.2% achieving clinical response per Adapted Mayo score at induction week 12 and randomized to
the maintenance primary efficacy analysis.
Safety Outcomes
Total adverse events and serious adverse events were reported at comparable rates among patients
treated with risankizumab 600 mg (57.8% and 9.4%, respectively), 1200 mg (44.3% and 6.6%), 1800 mg
(48.2% and 5.4%), and placebo (62.7% and 10.2%) (eTable 2). In the risankizumab groups, lower
proportions of patients reported severe adverse events and adverse events leading to study drug
discontinuation compared with placebo-treated patients. There were no dose-dependent patterns across the
risankizumab groups in any adverse event categories. The most frequently reported adverse events were
worsening of ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis, and headache. No patients in the risankizumab groups
reported malignancy, serious hypersensitivity, adjudicated anaphylactic reaction, adjudicated MACE, or
active tuberculosis. No serious hepatic events were reported or resulted in study drug discontinuation. The
majority of hepatic events represented laboratory abnormalities and were found to have no reasonable
possibility of being related to study drug, as assessed by the investigator. There were no deaths reported.

eResults 2. Additional Safety and Efficacy Outcomes for the Phase 3 Induction and Maintenance Study
Changes in Liver Enzymes for the 12-Week Induction and 52-Week Maintenance Periods
Rates for hepatic events were numerically higher in the risankizumab 360 mg group in comparison
with the risankizumab 180 mg and withdrawal treatment groups with no serious hepatic events across
treatment groups (Table 4, eTable 7). The majority of hepatic events were liver test increases. No elevations
in liver chemistry met the criteria for Hy's Law without other cause to explain the hepatic laboratory
abnormalities in either the induction or maintenance studies (eTable 8). Changes in liver enzymes and
chemistry were assessed as not clinically meaningful for either trial (eTables 8-9).
Efficacy and Safety Outcomes for All Patients Who Responded to 12-Week Risankizumab 1200 mg
Induction Therapy and Were Randomized to Maintenance
Efficacy analysis was performed for all patients who received risankizumab 1200 mg for only one
period of 12 weeks during the phase 2b/3 induction substudies who achieved clinical response and then
were randomized to the 52-week maintenance period. Despite there being a smaller sample size, patients
treated with risankizumab 360 mg achieved significantly higher rates of clinical remission compared with
patients in the placebo SC group (44.6% vs. 27.8%, adjusted treatment difference: 18.3%; P ≤ .001) at week
52 of maintenance (eTable 4). No difference was found for clinical remission in patients treated with the
risankizumab 180 mg dose compared with placebo SC treatment. Patients treated with either risankizumab
180 mg or 360 mg achieved significance versus placebo for several clinical, endoscopic, and patient-
reported outcomes.
Analysis for safety outcomes was performed for all patients who received risankizumab 1200 mg for
only one period of 12 weeks during the phase 3 induction substudy 2 and were randomized to maintenance.
Total adverse events were similar for all treatment groups. Higher rates of serious and severe adverse
events were observed in patients treated with placebo SC (8.9%, 6.7%), compared with risankizumab 180
mg (5.6%, 1.1%) or 360 mg (0%, 0%) (eTable 10). The most frequent adverse events with ≥ 10% in any
treatment group were COVID-19 and colitis ulcerative. Serious infections occurred at generally similar rates
in patients who received risankizumab 180 mg or placebo SC. No serious infections were observed in

patients treated with risankizumab 360 mg. No deaths, active tuberculosis, opportunistic infections (excluding
tuberculosis and herpes zoster), malignancies, adjudicated MACE, serious hypersensitivity, or adjudicated
hypersensitivity occurred in any of the treatment groups.
Patient Narratives
One Nontreatment-Emergent Death Due to Adenocarcinoma of the Colon (Risankizumab 360 mg SC Group)
A 62-year-old female was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon based on histopathology
from the screening endoscopy for the induction study, which was noted later by the central reader.
The patient was a clinical responder to the 12-week risankizumab IV induction treatment and rolled
over into the maintenance trial. During the maintenance study, the results from the screening biopsy were
received from the blinded central reader, and a serious adverse event of adenocarcinoma was documented
on day 36, with discontinuation of the study drug. The patient died due to adenocarcinoma on day 539, more
than a year after the 140-day follow-up call. The investigator assessed the event of adenocarcinoma as not
related to the study drug because the histopathology finding was from the screening endoscopy.
One Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma (Risankizumab 360 mg SC Group)
A 48-year-old female with a history of a breast lump and prior exposure to infliximab, adalimumab,
and vedolizumab experienced a serious event of invasive ductal breast carcinoma of the left breast on day
187. The diagnosis was confirmed by PET CT and MRI. The study drug was discontinued and a lumpectomy
and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The investigator assessed the event as having no
reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug.

eResults 3. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Results From Induction and Maintenance Studies
Following dosing of IV risankizumab 1200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8 during induction, risankizumab
exposures reached a geometric mean trough concentration of 101 µg/mL at week 12. During maintenance,
generally, dose-proportional risankizumab exposures were observed between the 180 mg and 360 mg doses
across the time course of the studies, reaching geometric mean concentrations of 9.6 µg/mL and 23.6 µg/mL
at week 52, respectively.
In evaluable patients who received 12-weeks of IV risankizumab induction therapy, the incidence of
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to risankizumab was 1.7% (n = 11/642)
and 0.8% (n = 5/642), respectively. In evaluable patients who received 12 weeks of risankizumab 1200 mg
induction followed by the maintenance regimen of 180 or 360 mg for up to 64 weeks of exposure, treatment-
emergent anti-drug and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 8.9% (n = 8/90) and 6.7% (n=6/90) for the
180 mg dose, or 4.4% (n = 4/91) and 2.2% (n = 2/91) for the 360 mg dose, of evaluated patients,
respectively.
The time to the first appearance of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies ranged from 4.0 to 42.0
weeks following the first risankizumab treatment during induction, and from 15.3 to 53.1 weeks for the
risankizumab 360 mg group and from 15.7 to 48.1 weeks for the risankizumab 180 mg group during
maintenance. No apparent impact of anti-drug antibodies on risankizumab exposure, efficacy, or safety
(injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions) was observed.
