Methods This prospective, randomised, parallel-group, phase 3 study (8-week double-blind acute [DBA] phase; 26-
week double-blind maintenance [DBM] phase; and an additional 8-week, open-label acute [OLA] phase) was
conducted in 33 sites across North America, Europe, and the Middle East between December 12, 2014, and
November 28, 2018. Eligible patients aged 5-17 years and weighing 18-90 kg were randomised 1:1 to either low
(900-2400 mg) or high (1800-4800 mg) oral doses of multimatrix mesalamine once daily, stratified by body
weight. Interactive response technology was used for randomisation. The primary efficacy outcome was to
estimate the clinical response of multimatrix mesalamine (two doses) in different weight groups. Efficacy and
safety analyses were conducted in the safety analysis set (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02093663; Study completed).
Findings Overall, 107 patients were randomised into the DBA (n = 54) or DBM phase (n = 88; directly or after
completing the double-blind or OLA phases); the overall safety analysis set included 105 patients. In the DBA phase,
the high-dose group (n = 17; 65.4%) achieved a higher clinical response rate than the low-dose (n = 10; 37.0%) group;
difference 28.3% (95% CI: 2.5-54.2; p = 0.039), odds ratio (OR) 3.21 (95% CI: 1.04-9.88). In the DBM phase at Week
26, similar proportions of patients maintained clinical response in the low-dose (n = 23; 54.8%) and high-dose (n = 24;
53.3%) groups: OR 0.99 (0.42-2.34); P = 0.981. Overall, 246 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were
reported in 73 patients (69.5%); 23 TEAEs in 14 patients (13.3%) were considered related to the study drug. No
treatment-related deaths were reported.
Interpretation Our findings suggested that the benefit-risk ratio of once-daily multimatrix mesalamine in paediatric
patients was favourable and comparable with that reported in adults with mild-to-moderate UC.
