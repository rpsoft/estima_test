IMPORTANCE The clinical effects of risankizumab (a monoclonal antibody that selectively
Multimedia
targets the p19 subunit of IL-23) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis are unknown.
Supplemental content
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab when administered as an
induction and a maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two phase 3 randomized clinical trials were conducted.
The induction trial was conducted at 261 clinical centers (in 41 countries) and enrolled 977
patients from November 5, 2020, to August 4, 2022 (final follow-up on May 16, 2023). The
maintenance trial was conducted at 238 clinical centers (in 37 countries) and enrolled 754
patients from August 28, 2018, to March 30, 2022 (final follow-up on April 11, 2023). Eligible
patients had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; a history of intolerance or
inadequate response to 1 or more conventional therapies, advanced therapies, or both types
of therapies; and no prior exposure to risankizumab.
INTERVENTIONS For the induction trial, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 1200 mg
of risankizumab or placebo administered intravenously at weeks O, 4, and 8. For the
maintenance trial, patients with a clinical response (determined using the adapted
Mayo score) after intravenous treatment with risankizumab were randomized 1:1:1 to receive
subcutaneous treatment with 180 mg or 360 mg of risankizumab or placebo (no longer
receiving risankizumab) every 8 weeks for 52 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was clinical remission (stool
frequency score ≤1 and not greater than baseline, rectal bleeding score of O, and endoscopic
subscore ≤1 without friability) at week 12 for the induction trial and at week 52 for the
maintenance trial.
RESULTS Among the 975 patients analyzed in the induction trial (aged 42.1 [SD, 13.8] years;
586/973 [60.1%] were male; and 677 [69.6%] were White), the clinical remission rates at
week 12 were 132/650 (20.3%) for 1200 mg of risankizumab and 20/325 (6.2%) for placebo
(adjusted between-group difference, 14.0% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.0%], P < .001). Among the
548 patients analyzed in the maintenance trial (aged 40.9 [SD, 14.0] years; 313 [57.1%] were
male; and 407 [74.3%] were White), the clinical remission rates at week 52 were 72/179
(40.2%) for 180 mg of risankizumab, 70/186 (37.6%) for 360 mg of risankizumab, and
46/183 (25.1%) for placebo (adjusted between-group difference for 180 mg of risankizumab
