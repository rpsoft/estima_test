'2,'Text 16,"'U lcerative colitis is a chronic, immune-mediated in- flammatory bowel disease associated with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and bowel urgency. In North America, the prevalence of ulcerative colitis is 0.4% and it affects ap- proximately 1.5 million people.¹ Ulcerative colitis symptoms are associated with reduced quality of life, impaired social and psychological function, and increased health care costs. 1-3 Cur- rent therapies, including corticosteroids and immunomodu- lators, are limited by lack of initial response, loss of response, and potential adverse events (such as increased risk of infec- tions or malignancy). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab, are a first-line therapy for ulcerative colitis; however, approximately one-third of pa- tients will not respond to initial treatment with a tumor ne- crosis factor inhibitor.⁴",'23,'70.31250000

Safety outcomes in this trial were consistent with previously reported safety outcomes in clinical trials of risankizumab for Crohn disease. 18,19 Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a history of intolerance or an inadequate response to advanced therapies (including infliximab, adali- mumab, golimumab, and vedolizumab; the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib, filgotinib, and upadacitinib; and ozani- mod, which is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modula- tor) that inhibit inflammatory pathways of inflammatory bowel disease. 20,21",'258,'96.43554688

'15,'Text 134,"'This finding is consistent with the results reported here from the induction and maintenance trials. Numerically higher clini- cal remission and endoscopic outcomes were observed in pa- tients without a history of inadequate response to advanced therapy during the maintenance trial for the 360-mg dose of risankizumab compared with 180-mg dose, but not in pa- tients with a history of inadequate response to advanced therapy. Although the reason for the attenuated efficacy of anti- inflammatory agents in patients with ulcerative colitis and a history of inadequate response to advanced therapy is not fully understood, there is accumulating evidence that uncon- trolled inflammation may be associated with immunological, structural, and neuromuscular changes in the diseased colon that may be less responsive to treatment. 24,25",'260,'97.60742188

First, in the maintenance trial, drug levels of risankizumab were de- tectable until week 16 in the placebo group (no longer receiv- ing risankizumab but received it during the induction trial), demonstrating continued risankizumab exposure from the in- duction trial; this may potentially inflate the response rates for outcomes in the placebo group during the maintenance trial. 19 Persistent suppression of serum concentrations of IL-22 (an ef- fector cytokine and biomarker of anti-IL-23 therapy) was ob- served from week 4 to week 52.",'262,'97.41210938
