Eligible patients aged 5-17 years and weighing 18-90 kg were randomised 1:1 to either low (900-2400 mg) or high (1800-4800 mg) oral doses of multimatrix mesalamine once daily, stratified by body weight. Interactive response technology was used for randomisation. The primary efficacy outcome was to estimate the clinical response of multimatrix mesalamine (two doses) in different weight groups.

In the DBM phase at Week 26, similar proportions of patients maintained clinical response in the low-dose (n = 23; 54.8%) and high-dose (n = 24; 53.3%) groups: OR 0.99 (0.42-2.34); P = 0.981. Overall, 246 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 73 patients (69.5%); 23 TEAEs in 14 patients (13.3%) were considered related to the study drug.
