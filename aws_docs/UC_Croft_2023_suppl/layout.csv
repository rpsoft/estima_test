The null hypothesis was that no difference was seen in the proportion of patients with a clinical response at Week 8 when a high or low-dose multimatrix mesalamine was administered. The numbers and proportions of patients with a clinical response at Week 8 and the difference between treatment groups, together with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-values, were calculated. The odds ratio (OR) comparing the two treatments and 95% CI were also calculated. In the DBM phase, the primary efficacy outcome was compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for three levels of Week 8 responder status (entered DBM phase directly, responder at Week 8 of the DBA phase, or responder at Week 8 of the OLA phase) on the DBM phase safety analysis set. The null hypothesis was that no difference was seen in the proportion of patients with a clinical response at Week 26 when a high or low dose of multimatrix mesalamine was administered. The numbers and proportions of patients with a clinical response at Week 26 and the difference between treatment groups, together with the two-sided 95% CI and associated p-values were calculated.

The percentage of patients with an improvement in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score from baseline to Week 8 was compared between treatment groups using a continuity-corrected chi-square test. In the DBM phase, clinical and endoscopic responses were compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for prior response status (entered the DBM phase directly, responder at Week 8 of the DBA phase, or responder at Week 8 of the OLA phase). The change in DUCS score from DBM phase Week 0 to Week 26 was compared between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance, including treatment group as a factor and DUCS score at DBM phase Week 0 and prior response status as covariates. The percentage of patients in remission at DBM phase Week 26 was compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for prior response status.
